hi claude. today i want to make a discord bot that lets claude be in discord servers (and group chats if that is possible??) . basically it works like this: if anyone pings @claude then claude will read the messages in that channel . i welcome your input on how we should build that context window . maybe for now we do it the naive way. anyway claude reads the messages and then replies. maybe the next few messages that get sent in that channel, claude will also read, and evaluate whether further replying is appropriate. anyway lets make this using typescript.
